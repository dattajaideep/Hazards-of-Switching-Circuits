# Hazards-of-Switching-Circuits
This is concerned with the detection and elimination of hazards from switching circuits, especially combinational logic circuits.It has explained different types of hazards possible and a method for their detection and elimination. The method involves simple manipulation of Boolean expression or K-Maps corresponding to logic networks.It not only detects the hazards in the circuit but also specifies the type of hazards in the circuit.Further, it can determine the terms the absence of which from the expression cause the hazards. Thus, the hazard can be eliminated by including these missing terms in the expression.The procedure has been given first before solving and problems. There are three methods(Spikes method,Hoffman’s method,and FORTRAN’s method) for detection and elimination of hazards but we named only two methods(Hoffman’s method,FORTRAN’S method) and used only one method i.e. Hoffman’s method.Two related results have been included.These results have been analyzed
